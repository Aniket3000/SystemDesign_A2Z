Alright, let’s compare them side by side so you can literally see how the coupling changes.
1. Tight-Coupled Implementation (bad example)
// Tight coupling: Both know about each other’s concrete classes

class WeatherStation {
    private List<Display> displays = new ArrayList<>();
    public void addDisplay(Display d) {
        displays.add(d);
    }
    public void setTemperature(int temp) {
        // Notify all displays
        for (Display d : displays) {
            d.update(temp);
        }
    }
}
class Display {
    private WeatherStation station; // Holds concrete reference
    public Display(WeatherStation station) {
        this.station = station;
    }
    public void update(int temperature) {
        System.out.println("Temperature is: " + temperature);
    }
}
Why tight coupled?
WeatherStation knows about the Display class directly.
Display knows about the WeatherStation class directly.
If you change one, you likely break the other.
2. Loose-Coupled Implementation (good example)
// Interfaces to decouple
interface Observer {
    void update(int temperature);
}
interface Observable {
    void register(Observer o);
    void unregister(Observer o);
    void notifyObservers();
}
// Concrete Observable
class WeatherStation implements Observable {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private int temperature;
    public void setTemperature(int temp) {
        this.temperature = temp;
        notifyObservers();
    }
    @Override
    public void register(Observer o) {
        observers.add(o);
    }

    @Override
    public void unregister(Observer o) {
        observers.remove(o);
    }
    @Override
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer o : observers) {
            o.update(temperature);
        }
    }
}

// Concrete Observer
class Display implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update(int temperature) {
        System.out.println("Temperature is: " + temperature);
    }
}
Why loose coupled?
WeatherStation doesn’t know about Display at all — just Observer interface.
Display doesn’t know about WeatherStation — just Observer contract.
You can swap in a new observer or observable without breaking existing code.

Alright, let’s dig into push vs pull in Observer pattern — this is exactly where the “should observer keep a reference to observable?” question comes in.

1. Push-based Observer (looser coupling)
Idea: When observable notifies, it pushes all relevant data in the update() call.
Observer doesn’t need to know the observable at all — it just reacts to the data.
Example:
@Override
public void notifyObservers() {
    for (Observer o : observers) {
        o.update(temperature); // Push the data
    }
}
class Display implements Observer {
    @Override
    public void update(int temperature) {
        System.out.println("Temp: " + temperature);
    }
}
✅ Pros:
Completely decoupled — observer doesn’t hold observable reference.
Easy to test.
❌ Cons:
Observable must decide what data to send (might send too much or too little).

2. Pull-based Observer (more coupling)
Idea: When observable notifies, it just signals “something changed” — observer pulls data it needs from observable.
This means observer must hold a reference to the observable (at least via an interface).
Example:
@Override
public void notifyObservers() {
    for (Observer o : observers) {
        o.update(this); // Pass reference to self
    }
}

class Display implements Observer {
    private final Observable observable;
    public Display(Observable observable) {
        this.observable = observable;
    }
    @Override
    public void update(Observable o) {
        int temperature = ((WeatherStation) o).getTemperature();
        System.out.println("Temp: " + temperature);
    }
}
✅ Pros:
Observer can fetch exactly what it needs, not just what observable chooses to send.
More flexible when observable has lots of data.
❌ Cons:
More coupling — observer must know observable’s API (or at least cast it to the right type).
Harder to swap out observable without breaking observers.
When to choose which
Push → when data to send is simple and consistent across observers (e.g., a single temperature value).
Pull → when observers need different slices of observable’s state, and it’s inefficient to push everything.

Yes — there are other ways to implement the Observer idea that avoid the classic A has B, B has A trap entirely.
The most common alternatives fall into three buckets: event bus, reactive streams, and pub-sub with message brokers.

1. Event Bus (Decoupled In-Process Communication)
Instead of the observable directly tracking observers:
Both Observable and Observer talk to a mediator (event bus).
The bus handles registrations and broadcasts.
Example:
class EventBus {
    private Map<String, List<Consumer<Object>>> listeners = new HashMap<>();
    public void subscribe(String event, Consumer<Object> listener) {
        listeners.computeIfAbsent(event, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(listener);
    }
    public void publish(String event, Object data) {
        for (var listener : listeners.getOrDefault(event, List.of())) {
            listener.accept(data);
        }
    }
}
Effect:
Observable → bus.publish("temperatureChanged", 25)
Observer → bus.subscribe("temperatureChanged", temp -> { ... })
Neither knows about the other at all.

2. Reactive Streams (RxJava, Project Reactor, etc.)
You model your observable as a stream of events.
Observers subscribe to the stream and handle emissions asynchronously.
Example (RxJava style):
Observable<Integer> temperatureStream = Observable.create(emitter -> {
    // emit new temps
    emitter.onNext(25);
    emitter.onNext(26);
});
temperatureStream.subscribe(temp -> System.out.println("Temp: " + temp));
Effect:
No manual register/notify logic.
Streams are first-class objects, so you can map, filter, merge, etc.

3. Pub-Sub via Message Broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Pub/Sub)
Publisher sends messages to a topic/channel.
Subscribers listen to that topic.
Often used when observer and observable are in different processes/machines.
Example:
Weather station publishes to topic weather.temperature.
Displays subscribe to that topic.
Communication goes through broker → completely decoupled, even across the network.


--------------------------------Main summary---------------------------------
Exactly — you’ve spotted the core truth:
you never get zero coupling; you just move the coupling to a place that’s easier to manage or scale.
Let’s break this down step-by-step:
1. What coupling are we moving?
In classic Observer, the observable holds a list of observers, so it’s directly aware of them (even if only via an interface).
In Event Bus / Pub-Sub, both observable and observer now depend on the broker’s API, not on each other.
So yes — they are now coupled to the mediator instead of each other.
2. Why is this better?
The benefit isn’t that coupling disappears — it’s that:
Coupling becomes uniform → everyone just talks to the same message API.
Direct dependencies between features are removed → you can add/remove observers without touching observable code.
Observable doesn’t even know if there are any observers → great for scaling and loose deployment.
3. Real benefits of decoupling through a mediator
Independence in deployment
With a broker, observable and observer can run in different processes or machines.
You can scale observers separately (e.g., 5 observers for heavy processing, 1 observable source).
Pluggability
Add a new observer without touching existing observable code.
Remove an observer without recompiling anything else.
Asynchronous communication
Observable doesn’t block waiting for observers to finish work.
Great for high throughput, distributed systems.
Testability
You can mock the broker easily and test publisher/subscriber logic in isolation.
